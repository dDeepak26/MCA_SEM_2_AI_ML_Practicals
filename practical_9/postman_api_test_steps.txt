Great! Using Postman is also a convenient way to send POST requests to your Flask server for making predictions. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Open Postman**: If you haven't already installed Postman, you can download it from the official website (https://www.postman.com/downloads/) and install it on your system.

2. **Create a New Request**: Open Postman and click on the "New" button to create a new request.

3. **Set Request Type and URL**: In the request tab, set the request type to "POST" and enter the URL of your Flask server's `/predict` endpoint. By default, if you're running the Flask server locally, the URL will be `http://localhost:5000/predict`.

4. **Set Request Body**: Click on the "Body" tab below the URL field. Select "raw" as the input type, and choose "JSON" from the dropdown menu. Then, in the text area, enter the JSON data representing the input for your model. For example:
   ```
   {
       "input": [5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2]
   }
   ```
   Replace `[5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2]` with the actual input data you want to send for prediction.

5. **Set Request Headers**: Click on the "Headers" tab below the URL field. Add a new header with key `Content-Type` and value `application/json`. This header tells the server that you're sending JSON data in the request body.

6. **Send Request**: Once you've set up the request type, URL, body, and headers, you can click on the "Send" button to send the POST request to your Flask server.

7. **View Response**: After sending the request, you should receive a response from the server containing the prediction. You can view the response in the "Response" tab below the request area.

That's it! You've successfully used Postman to send a POST request to your Flask server's `/predict` endpoint and received a prediction response. You can now use Postman for further testing or integration with your applications.
